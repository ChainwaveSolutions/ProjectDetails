# Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Filing Guide and Requirements

## Introduction

Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) are a critical component of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. At Chainwave Solutions Inc., we are committed to preventing money laundering and other financial crimes. This document outlines the requirements and procedures for filing SARs in accordance with regulatory standards and internal policies.

## What is a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)?

A Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is a document that financial institutions and certain businesses must file with regulatory authorities to report any suspicious transactions or activities that could be related to money laundering, fraud, or other financial crimes. SARs are confidential and play a vital role in helping authorities detect and prevent illegal activities.

## When to File a SAR

A SAR must be filed when there is a suspicion or knowledge that a transaction or series of transactions involves:
- **Money laundering or terrorist financing**: Activities that may indicate the use of the financial system to move illicit funds or support terrorist activities.
- **Fraudulent activities**: Transactions that appear to be structured to evade regulations, such as structuring deposits to avoid reporting thresholds.
- **Unusual or unexplained activity**: Any transactions that do not fit the expected pattern of the customer’s behavior, especially when the source of funds is unclear.

### Examples of Situations Requiring SAR Filing

- A customer attempts to make a large transaction without providing the required identification or provides false information.
- A series of transactions that appear to be structured to evade the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting thresholds.
- Transactions involving funds transfer to or from high-risk jurisdictions without a clear business purpose.

## SAR Filing Requirements

### 1. Internal Reporting Procedures
- **Employee Awareness**: All employees must be trained to recognize potentially suspicious activity and report it to the AML Compliance Officer.
- **Internal Review**: The AML Compliance Officer will review the reported activity to determine if it meets the criteria for SAR filing.
- **Record Keeping**: Maintain detailed records of all reports made by employees, the review process, and the decision to file (or not file) a SAR.

### 2. Filing Timeline
- A SAR must be filed within **30 calendar days** of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR.
- If no suspect is identified, this deadline may be extended to **60 calendar days**.

### 3. Content of the SAR
The SAR must contain the following information:
- **Subject Information**: Details about the individual or entity involved in the suspicious activity, including name, address, and identification numbers.
- **Description of Suspicious Activity**: A clear and concise narrative of the suspicious activity, including dates, amounts, and any relevant circumstances.
- **Nature of Suspicion**: Explanation of why the activity is considered suspicious, including any patterns or behaviors that led to the suspicion.
- **Supporting Documentation**: Attach or reference any documents or records that support the SAR, such as transaction records or customer identification documents.

### 4. Confidentiality
- SARs must be treated with the utmost confidentiality. Employees are prohibited from informing any individual or entity that a SAR has been filed against them or disclosing any information that would indicate a SAR filing.
- Unauthorized disclosure of a SAR or its contents can lead to severe penalties, including criminal prosecution.

### 5. Filing Method
- SARs should be filed electronically through the appropriate regulatory body’s online system (e.g., FinCEN’s BSA E-Filing System for U.S.-based companies).
- Ensure that all fields are accurately completed, and the SAR is filed promptly within the required timeframe.
