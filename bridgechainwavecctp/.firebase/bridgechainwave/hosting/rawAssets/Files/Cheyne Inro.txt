leave this til our trustbase builtup with a quality service and product although ......
bridge partner and close partnership required for Cex bridge to private chain ( See Cex )

Goods and Services

If Looking at utilising Payment of goods and services
Product and service marketplace (see ebay amazon and even Fiverr services )
To do this id recomend a NFT Style system with users creating a product (created as and list as an NFT in data sense)
NFT marketplace with buy sell auction and Pay with Fiat or #7bc3fdchips see opensea payment types
with this the metadata holds product information and all relevent data to market as a product
NFT Creaters would be "Sellers" and process the sale or service and deliver the products

this being monitored by a customer support and also fraud team for nefarious dealings and will incur a premium insurance that would have to be honoured when proven false
so think sellers hold a bank of min funds and lose it if nefariuos

ok so the thre options

also

Business Directory with searchable business and services that will be maped and location data listed when business registers on elixr site
then seller score hold commitments
and all the details
phonebook of elixr businesses we support

then comes hardware
pay with defi in store
look up afterpay zippay muni and all others

so Yup can do remember the meeting in full and am excited to start works if chosen to be part of elixr team
i will require small items and funds to be able to complete tasks at hand and will submit spend request of thinking of these items to be discussed and approved if satisfactory

i am a business professional but u wont know it by how i speak or come accross though i will be sure to impress with my skillset and knowledgebase
