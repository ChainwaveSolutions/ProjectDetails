# Circle Mint Access Requirements

To use **Circle Mint** and provide USDC minting services for your business, there are several steps and compliance requirements you must meet. Circle Mint is available for businesses and institutional clients, not for individual retail consumers. Below are the key requirements:

## 1. Business or Institutional Account
- Circle Mint is **exclusively available** for **businesses** and **institutional clients**, such as:
  - Crypto exchanges
  - Institutional traders
  - Financial institutions
  - Wallet providers
- Individual consumer accounts are **not supported**. If you're an individual, you can still access USDC through third-party providers like crypto exchanges【21†source】【22†source】.

## 2. KYC/AML Compliance
- You will need to complete **Know Your Customer (KYC)** and **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** checks as part of Circle's compliance process. This includes:
  - Submitting business registration documents.
  - Verifying company ownership and key personnel.
  - Passing background checks and **sanctions screening**【20†source】.

## 3. Bank Account Setup
- A **business bank account** must be connected to your Circle Mint account to fund USDC minting. Supported payment methods include:
  - Wire transfers
  - ACH transfers (for U.S. customers)
  - SEPA transfers (for European customers)
- **Instant settlement** is available if your bank participates in Circle’s instant settlement program【21†source】【22†source】.

## 4. Geographical Availability
- **Circle Mint** is available in **185 countries**, but some features (like instant settlement) may be limited to certain regions. Ensure your bank and region are supported for minting【20†source】.

## 5. API Integration (Optional)
- Circle provides robust APIs for automated operations such as:
  - Minting and redeeming USDC.
  - Cross-chain transfers.
  - Managing treasury operations【21†source】.
- You can integrate these APIs into your business systems for enhanced functionality and automation.

## 6. Account Approval Process
- The approval process includes thorough checks by Circle’s compliance team. This involves:
  - Verification of business details.
  - Assessment of eligibility and compliance.
- Approval can take **several days** to **a week** depending on the complexity of the business and regulatory requirements【21†source】【22†source】.

## 7. Multi-User Roles and Permissions
- Circle Mint allows businesses to set up **multi-user roles** with **granular permissions**, so different financial tasks can be delegated securely within the organization. This helps with oversight and transparency of funds management【20†source】.

## Getting Started
Once your account is approved, you can begin minting USDC directly using your bank account. You can also use Circle’s APIs for automating minting and redemption processes, allowing for seamless integration into your existing systems.
