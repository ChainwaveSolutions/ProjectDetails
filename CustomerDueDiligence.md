# Chainwave Solutions Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Program

Chainwave Solutions is committed to maintaining the highest standards of compliance and security in all our business relationships. To this end, we have implemented a comprehensive Customer Due Diligence (CDD) program designed to verify the identity of our customers, understand their business activities, and continuously monitor transactions for any unusual or suspicious activity. This document outlines the key components of our CDD program.

## Overview

Our CDD program ensures that Chainwave Solutions meets all regulatory requirements and provides a secure environment for our customers. The program is built on the following core components:

1. **Customer Identification and Verification**
2. **Beneficial Ownership Verification**
3. **Understanding Customer Business and Account Purpose**
4. **Ongoing Transaction Monitoring**
5. **Compliance and Audit Trail**

## 1. Customer Identification and Verification

We collect and verify the identification information of each customer before establishing a business relationship. This process includes:

- **Data Collection**: We collect key identification details such as the customer’s name, address, date of birth, and identification numbers (e.g., passport or driver's license).
- **Verification**: To ensure the authenticity of the provided information, we integrate with leading third-party identity verification services. Verification statuses are maintained and updated within our system.

Our verification process ensures that only legitimate customers are onboarded, minimizing the risk of fraud and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

## 2. Beneficial Ownership Verification

In addition to verifying the primary account holders, we identify and verify the beneficial owners associated with each account:

- **Data Collection**: We gather information about the beneficial owners, including their identification details and their relationship to the account.
- **Verification**: The verification process for beneficial owners mirrors that of the primary account holders, using the same rigorous standards.

This step ensures transparency and accountability, preventing the use of our platform for illicit activities.

## 3. Understanding Customer Business and Account Purpose

To better serve our customers and assess potential risks, we gain a deep understanding of their business activities:

- **Data Collection**: We collect detailed information about the customer’s business, the purpose of the account, and the expected transaction patterns.
- **Risk Profiling**: Based on the collected information, we develop a risk profile for each customer. This profile helps us tailor our services to meet the customer’s needs while ensuring that any potential risks are adequately managed.

Understanding our customers' businesses allows us to provide more personalized services while maintaining a strong compliance framework.

## 4. Ongoing Transaction Monitoring

Continuous monitoring is key to detecting and preventing suspicious activities:

- **Transaction Monitoring**: We monitor all customer transactions in real-time, flagging any that deviate from the expected patterns based on the customer’s risk profile.
- **Alerts and Reporting**: Our system automatically generates alerts for any suspicious transactions, enabling prompt investigation and action.

This proactive approach ensures that we can respond quickly to any potential threats, safeguarding both our customers and our business.

## 5. Compliance and Audit Trail

To maintain transparency and accountability, we keep a detailed record of all CDD activities:

- **Data Storage**: All CDD-related data is securely stored with strict access controls, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.
- **Audit Trail**: We maintain a comprehensive audit trail of all customer interactions, CDD checks, and compliance decisions. This ensures that we can demonstrate our adherence to regulatory requirements at all times.

Our robust compliance and audit procedures help us maintain trust with our customers and regulatory bodies.

## Integration with Other Systems

Our CDD program is integrated with external compliance tools, AML services, and identity verification APIs to ensure comprehensive coverage. Additionally, we provide a dashboard for our compliance officers to monitor and manage all aspects of the CDD process in real-time.

## Conclusion

At Chainwave Solutions, we prioritize the safety and security of our customers and our business. Our Customer Due Diligence program is designed to meet the highest standards of compliance, providing a secure and trustworthy platform for all our customers.

### Chainwave Solutions CDD Program - MongoDB Implementation


Chainwave Solutions has developed a robust Customer Due Diligence (CDD) program using MongoDB to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain the integrity of our business relationships. This document provides an overview of the MongoDB schema design and the functionality that supports our CDD processes.

## 1. Customer Identification and Verification

To collect and verify customer identification information, we use the following MongoDB schema:

```javascript
const customerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    address: String,
    dateOfBirth: Date,
    idNumber: String,
    verificationStatus: String, // e.g., "pending", "verified", "rejected"
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```

### **Purpose:**
- **Data Collection:** Stores essential identification details such as name, address, and identification numbers.
- **Verification:** Tracks the status of identity verification, ensuring only legitimate customers are onboarded.

## 2. Beneficial Ownership Verification

For beneficial ownership verification, the following schema is utilized:

```javascript
const beneficialOwnerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    customerId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, // Reference to the customer
    name: String,
    idNumber: String,
    ownershipPercentage: Number,
    verificationStatus: String,
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```

### **Purpose:**
- **Data Collection:** Captures information about beneficial owners, including their identification and ownership details.
- **Verification:** Ensures transparency by verifying the beneficial owners associated with each account.

## 3. Understanding Customer Business and Account Purpose

To understand the customer’s business activities and the purpose of their account, we define the following schema:

```javascript
const customerProfileSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    customerId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    businessType: String,
    accountPurpose: String,
    expectedTransactionVolume: Number,
    riskProfile: String, // e.g., "low", "medium", "high"
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```

### **Purpose:**
- **Risk Profiling:** Creates a risk profile for each customer based on their business type and expected transaction volume, helping us manage potential risks effectively.

## 4. Ongoing Transaction Monitoring

Our ongoing monitoring processes are supported by the following transaction schema:

```javascript
const transactionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    customerId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    transactionAmount: Number,
    transactionDate: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
    transactionType: String, // e.g., "deposit", "withdrawal"
    suspiciousFlag: Boolean,
    alertGenerated: Boolean,
});
```

### **Purpose:**
- **Monitoring:** Tracks each customer transaction, flags suspicious activities, and generates alerts for further investigation.
- **Compliance:** Ensures all transactions are monitored in real-time, aligning with regulatory requirements.

## 5. Compliance and Audit Trail

To maintain a detailed audit trail of all compliance-related activities, we use the following schema:

```javascript
const auditLogSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    customerId: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    action: String, // e.g., "verification", "transaction monitoring"
    performedBy: String,
    timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```

### **Purpose:**
- **Audit Trail:** Logs all actions performed on customer accounts, providing a transparent record for compliance reviews and audits.

## Conclusion

This MongoDB implementation supports Chainwave Solutions' commitment to maintaining the highest standards of customer due diligence. By leveraging these schemas and structures, we ensure that our CDD processes are robust, compliant, and effective in mitigating risks.
