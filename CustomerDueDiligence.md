# Chainwave Solutions CDD Program - Data Collection and Verification

## Introduction

At Chainwave Solutions, we are committed to upholding the highest standards of compliance and security in all our business interactions. To achieve this, we have implemented a comprehensive Customer Due Diligence (CDD) program designed to ensure the integrity of our customer base, understand their business activities, and continuously monitor transactions for unusual or suspicious activity.

## 1. Customer Identification and Verification

The first step in our CDD process is the collection and verification of customer identification information. This process involves the following key steps:

### **Data Collection:**
- **Personal Information:** We gather essential identification details from each customer, including:
  - Full Name
  - Address
  - Date of Birth
  - Identification Numbers (e.g., passport, driver's license)

### **Verification:**
- **KYC Services Integration:** To verify the authenticity of the provided identification information, we integrate third-party identity verification services such as **Jumio** and **Trulioo** into our system. These services provide:
  - **Automated Global Database Checks:** Verifications are cross-referenced against global databases to ensure that the identity is genuine.
  - **Document Verification:** Advanced technology is used to validate the legitimacy of identification documents provided by the customer.
  - **Facial Recognition and Liveness Detection:** Ensures that the person providing the identification is the rightful owner and is physically present.
- **Verification Status Tracking:** The results of these verifications are documented, and the status is tracked to ensure only verified customers proceed in our system. This status could be:
  - **Pending:** Awaiting verification
  - **Verified:** Successfully verified
  - **Rejected:** Verification failed or further review required

Through these KYC (Know Your Customer) services, we ensure that the identities of our customers are accurately verified, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

## 2. Beneficial Ownership Verification

In addition to verifying the primary account holders, we identify and verify the beneficial owners associated with each account. This process includes:

### **Data Collection:**
- **Beneficial Owner Information:** For each account, we collect the following information about beneficial owners:
  - Full Name
  - Identification Numbers
  - Ownership Percentage or Stake in the Account

### **Verification:**
- **KYC Services Integration:** Similar to account holders, the beneficial owners undergo the same rigorous verification process through our integrated third-party services. This ensures that all individuals with a significant ownership stake in the account are legitimate and properly verified.

This step is crucial in preventing the misuse of accounts by hidden or fraudulent actors and ensures transparency and accountability within our customer base.

## 3. Understanding Customer Business and Account Purpose

To better serve our customers and assess potential risks, we gather detailed information about their business activities and the purpose of their accounts:

### **Data Collection:**
- **Business Information:** We collect comprehensive details about the customer’s business, including:
  - Type of Business or Industry
  - Purpose of the Account (e.g., transaction, savings, investment)
  - Expected Transaction Volume and Frequency

### **Risk Profiling:**
- **Customer Risk Assessment:** Based on the information collected, we create a risk profile for each customer. This profile helps us to:
  - Identify any potential risks associated with the customer’s business activities
  - Tailor our monitoring efforts to ensure that any unusual activity is detected promptly

Understanding our customers’ businesses allows us to provide more personalized services while maintaining a strong compliance framework.

## 4. Ongoing Transaction Monitoring

Continuous monitoring is key to detecting and preventing suspicious activities. Our process includes:

### **Data Collection:**
- **Transaction Records:** We maintain detailed records of all customer transactions, capturing:
  - Transaction Amounts
  - Transaction Dates
  - Types of Transactions (e.g., deposits, withdrawals)
  - Geographical Location of Transactions

### **Monitoring and Alerts:**
- **Automated Monitoring:** Transactions are continuously monitored against the customer’s risk profile. Any deviations or unusual patterns are flagged for further review.
- **Alert System:** Automated alerts are generated for transactions that appear suspicious, enabling immediate investigation and action.

This proactive approach ensures that we can respond quickly to any potential threats, safeguarding both our customers and our business.

## 5. Compliance and Audit Trail

To ensure transparency and accountability, we maintain a detailed audit trail of all compliance-related activities:

### **Data Collection:**
- **Action Logs:** We document all actions taken during the CDD process, including:
  - Verification Steps and Results
  - Transaction Monitoring Activities
  - Compliance Decisions and Actions Taken

### **Audit Trail:**
- **Compliance Reviews:** Our audit trail provides a transparent record of all customer interactions and compliance activities, which is essential for internal reviews and regulatory audits.

By maintaining detailed records, we ensure that our CDD program is both effective and transparent, meeting the highest standards of regulatory compliance.

## Conclusion

Chainwave Solutions’ Customer Due Diligence program is designed to protect our business and our customers by ensuring that all customer interactions are based on verified, trustworthy relationships.

## Code Systems for KYC KYB

Initial implementation of a basic API and database setup for the Customer Due Diligence (CDD) program using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB:

### **1. Project Setup**

First, initialize your project and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
mkdir cdd-program
cd cdd-program
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose body-parser axios
```

### **2. Database Models**

Create the necessary MongoDB models for storing customer information, beneficial owners, and audit logs.

#### **models/Customer.js**

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const customerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    address: String,
    dateOfBirth: Date,
    idNumber: String,
    verificationStatus: {
        type: String,
        enum: ['pending', 'verified', 'rejected'],
        default: 'pending'
    },
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Customer', customerSchema);
```

#### **models/BeneficialOwner.js**

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const beneficialOwnerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    customerId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Customer' },
    name: String,
    idNumber: String,
    ownershipPercentage: Number,
    verificationStatus: {
        type: String,
        enum: ['pending', 'verified', 'rejected'],
        default: 'pending'
    },
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('BeneficialOwner', beneficialOwnerSchema);
```

#### **models/AuditLog.js**

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const auditLogSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    customerId: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Customer' },
    action: String, // e.g., "verification", "transaction monitoring"
    performedBy: String,
    timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('AuditLog', auditLogSchema);
```

### **3. API Implementation**

Create the API to handle customer data and verification.

#### **index.js**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const axios = require('axios');

const Customer = require('./models/Customer');
const BeneficialOwner = require('./models/BeneficialOwner');
const AuditLog = require('./models/AuditLog');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/cdd', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true
});

// Endpoint to add a new customer
app.post('/customers', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const customer = new Customer(req.body);
        await customer.save();
        
        // Log the action
        const auditLog = new AuditLog({
            customerId: customer._id,
            action: 'Customer Created',
            performedBy: 'System',
        });
        await auditLog.save();

        res.status(201).send(customer);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).send(error);
    }
});

// Endpoint to verify a customer using a third-party KYC service (e.g., Jumio, Trulioo)
app.post('/customers/:id/verify', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const customer = await Customer.findById(req.params.id);
        if (!customer) {
            return res.status(404).send({ error: 'Customer not found' });
        }

        // Call third-party KYC service (example using a mock API)
        const response = await axios.post('https://api.example.com/verify', {
            idNumber: customer.idNumber,
            name: customer.name,
            dateOfBirth: customer.dateOfBirth
        });

        // Update the verification status based on the response
        if (response.data.verified) {
            customer.verificationStatus = 'verified';
        } else {
            customer.verificationStatus = 'rejected';
        }
        await customer.save();

        // Log the action
        const auditLog = new AuditLog({
            customerId: customer._id,
            action: 'Customer Verified',
            performedBy: 'System',
        });
        await auditLog.save();

        res.send(customer);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).send(error);
    }
});

// Endpoint to add a beneficial owner
app.post('/customers/:customerId/beneficial-owners', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const beneficialOwner = new BeneficialOwner({
            ...req.body,
            customerId: req.params.customerId
        });
        await beneficialOwner.save();

        // Log the action
        const auditLog = new AuditLog({
            customerId: req.params.customerId,
            action: 'Beneficial Owner Added',
            performedBy: 'System',
        });
        await auditLog.save();

        res.status(201).send(beneficialOwner);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).send(error);
    }
});

// Endpoint to fetch customer details along with beneficial owners
app.get('/customers/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const customer = await Customer.findById(req.params.id);
        if (!customer) {
            return res.status(404).send({ error: 'Customer not found' });
        }
        const beneficialOwners = await BeneficialOwner.find({ customerId: customer._id });
        res.send({ customer, beneficialOwners });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).send(error);
    }
});

// Endpoint to get audit logs for a customer
app.get('/customers/:id/audit-logs', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const auditLogs = await AuditLog.find({ customerId: req.params.id });
        res.send(auditLogs);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).send(error);
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

### **4. Running the Application**

Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine, then start the application:

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will be up and running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### **5. API Endpoints Overview**

- **POST /customers**: Create a new customer.
- **POST /customers/:id/verify**: Verify a customer's identity using a third-party KYC service.
- **POST /customers/:customerId/beneficial-owners**: Add a beneficial owner to a customer account.
- **GET /customers/:id**: Retrieve customer details along with beneficial owners.
- **GET /customers/:id/audit-logs**: Fetch audit logs for a specific customer.

### **6. Integration with KYC Services**

The `/customers/:id/verify` endpoint demonstrates how to integrate with a third-party KYC service. Replace the mock API call with an actual service like Jumio or Trulioo by using their respective APIs to perform the identity verification.



This setup provides a basic yet functional implementation of a CDD program using Node.js and MongoDB. The API handles customer data collection, verification through third-party services, beneficial ownership management, and auditing, all essential components of a robust CDD program.
