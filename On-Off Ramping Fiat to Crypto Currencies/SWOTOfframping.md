- **Stripe** is a powerful, customizable solution for businesses and online platforms needing fast access to fiat through various payment methods. It offers limited crypto support, but its strength lies in the e-commerce and SaaS sectors.
- **Circle Mint (USDC)** offers the most advanced solution for blockchain-based off-ramping, with fast conversion from USDC to fiat and cross-chain support. It is ideal for blockchain-native businesses and institutions, but its focus on USDC limits flexibility in fiat off-ramping beyond USD.
